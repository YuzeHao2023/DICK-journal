## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## GitHub Pages Deployment (Manuel-Turner/DICK)

This repository is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

1. Go to `Settings -> Pages` in GitHub.
2. Under `Build and deployment`, set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.
3. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from the `Actions` tab with `workflow_dispatch`).

The Pages site URL is:

- `https://manuel-turner.github.io/DICK/`

Astro base URL settings are already configured in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
site: "https://manuel-turner.github.io",
base: "/DICK",
```

This is required so built asset paths resolve correctly on the `/DICK/` GitHub Pages subpath.
