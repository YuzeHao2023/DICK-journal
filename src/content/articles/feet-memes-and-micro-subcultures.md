## Introduction

The phrase-level and visual references associated with foot-fetish discourse now appear regularly in mainstream meme culture, celebrity commentary, and platform moderation debates. Their circulation is analytically useful because the topic is widely recognizable, frequently joked about, and often governed through context-dependent moderation practices.

Rather than treating these references as merely comedic artifacts, this article studies them as signifiers that move between subcultural, mainstream, and policy-facing contexts. Our focus is not explicit content, but the social mechanisms through which recognition, discomfort, and stigma are produced and managed.

## Corpus and Sampling Strategy

We constructed a corpus of 2,400 public-facing items drawn from three platform types: short-form video comments, image-meme repost contexts, and forum-style discussion threads. Sampling was stratified by platform and time window to avoid over-representing high-visibility viral events.

Items were included when they contained:

- a textual or visual foot-fetish signifier recognizable to general audiences
- observable user responses (e.g., replies, moderation labels, or repost captions)
- sufficient context to classify pragmatic function

We excluded explicit sexual content, private or semi-private posts, and posts where context could not be responsibly inferred from available material.

## Methods

### Coding Framework

We developed a coding scheme for pragmatic function and social positioning. Primary categories included:

- ironic signaling
- accusation or labeling of others
- self-referential identity play
- moderation negotiation
- stigma distancing
- content warning or boundary-setting

Two coders annotated a 20% overlap sample before full coding. Adjudication memos were used to refine boundary cases involving irony and quoted speech.

### Corpus Handling

To reduce amplification risk, we stored only text excerpts needed for coding and derived feature tags for images instead of archiving image files in the working dataset. This design improved reproducibility while limiting redistribution of sensitive or decontextualized material.

### Limitations

Our corpus is platform-biased toward English-language, highly visible discourse and does not capture private community norms. Pragmatic interpretation remains probabilistic in short or fragmentary comments, particularly where irony markers are absent.

## Findings

Three findings were robust across platforms.

1. Foot-fetish signifiers often functioned as shorthand for social recognition rather than explicit sexual reference.
2. Users frequently performed stigma management by combining acknowledgment with distancing language ("we all know what this means" followed by denial, irony, or deflection).
3. Moderation actions were inconsistent when references were indirect, humorous, or nested inside quotation and reaction formats.

These patterns suggest that platform governance struggles less with topic presence than with pragmatic ambiguity.

## Discussion

The topic demonstrates how stigmatized signifiers can become memetically portable without losing their social charge. Familiarity does not eliminate stigma; instead, it redistributes it through irony, accusation, and selective deniability.

This case also illustrates a broader methodological point: researchers can study culturally sensitive signifiers through circulation patterns, moderation language, and interactional uptake without reproducing explicit material.

## Conclusion

Foot-fetish signifiers are a useful analytic case for studying the migration of subcultural references into mainstream platforms. A serious method can illuminate memetic circulation, platform norms, and stigma management while maintaining non-explicit research boundaries.
