title: "“I’m gay” Phrase Study"
slug: "i-am-gay-phrase-study"
tagline: "Pragmatics, quotation, identity signaling, and interpretive context in a high-salience phrase."
scope: "This column examines how the phrase “I’m gay” is used, quoted, indexed, recontextualized, and interpreted across media, conversation, and institutional settings. We prioritize linguistic, sociological, and media-analytic approaches that distinguish self-identification, quotation, parody, misattribution, and platform-mediated circulation."
callForPapers: |
  We invite discourse analysis, corpus linguistics, conversation analysis, moderation-policy studies, and measurement work on phrase-level interpretation and context collapse. Methods are encouraged, including annotation frameworks for pragmatic function, quoted speech detection, and intercoder reliability in sensitive language analysis.

  Out of scope: derogatory framing, decontextualized examples intended to inflame, or submissions that treat identity categories as punchlines rather than objects of scholarly analysis.

The column emphasizes context-sensitive analysis and careful distinction between speaker intent, audience uptake, and platform framing.
