title: "Game Cheating & Countermeasures"
slug: "game-cheating-and-countermeasures"
tagline: "Measurement, detection, governance, and evaluation frameworks for competitive integrity."
scope: "This column focuses on cheating detection, anti-cheat policy, evaluation design, measurement error, and governance tradeoffs in digital games and esports. We welcome work from HCI, security, game studies, statistics, and platform governance perspectives, especially studies that emphasize reproducible detection benchmarks and harm reduction."
callForPapers: |
  We invite submissions on detection methodology, benchmark construction, synthetic or consented datasets, reviewer protocols, false-positive analysis, appeals systems, and institutional design for fair enforcement. Methods papers and replication studies are strongly encouraged, particularly those comparing detection models under realistic deployment constraints.

  Out of scope: instructions for creating cheats, evading anti-cheat systems, operational exploit development, or deployment guidance that facilitates wrongdoing.

The column is explicitly countermeasure-oriented. Submissions should improve detection quality, accountability, or policy clarity without enabling abuse.
