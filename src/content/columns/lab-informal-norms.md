title: "Laboratory Informal Norms"
slug: "lab-informal-norms"
tagline: "Tacit rules, mentorship cultures, and governance gaps in research organizations."
scope: "This column studies informal norms in laboratories, graduate programs, and research groups, including authorship expectations, mentoring cultures, conflict management, social boundaries, and the mismatch between policy and everyday practice. We welcome evidence-rich work that addresses institutional design, risk, and accountability."
callForPapers: |
  We invite reflective analyses, interview studies, institutional comparisons, policy evaluations, and methods for studying tacit organizational behavior in academic and research settings. Methods are encouraged, especially approaches for anonymization, narrative analysis, and responsible handling of reputational risk.

  Out of scope: personal accusations without evidence, identifiable gossip, advice intended to exploit power asymmetries, or submissions that encourage policy circumvention.

This column is designed for careful work on topics that are often discussed informally but rarely examined with methodological transparency.
