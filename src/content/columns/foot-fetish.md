title: "Foot Fetish"
slug: "foot-fetish"
tagline: "Cultural circulation, stigma management, and platform governance around a recognizable subcultural signifier."
scope: "This column examines how foot-fetish references, jokes, symbols, and reputation markers circulate across mainstream and niche digital culture. We prioritize work on memetic transmission, moderation policy, stigma, self-presentation, and the boundary between subcultural literacy and sensational framing."
callForPapers: |
  We invite empirical and conceptual submissions on representational patterns, platform norms, moderation language, audience interpretation, and the social organization of stigmatized but widely referenced subcultural content. Methods are especially encouraged, including coding protocols, corpus design, annotation standards, and comparative platform sampling strategies.

  Out of scope: explicit sexual content, erotic instruction, solicitation, cataloging of explicit material, or submissions that primarily aim to provoke rather than analyze social processes.

This column treats an unusual but widely recognizable topic as a case study in serious cultural analysis. Contributions should foreground method, interpretation, and policy relevance rather than spectacle.
