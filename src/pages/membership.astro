        <p>
          This page explains the demo access model used across article pages. OA articles are readable in full, while
          Non-OA articles expose metadata and abstracts publicly and reserve full text for members.

          <h2>Open Access (OA)</h2>
          <p>
            OA articles are immediately readable without subscription barriers. In this demo, OA publication is funded
            through a low article processing charge (APC) paid by authors at acceptance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The OA publishing fee (APC) is <strong>$9.9</strong> one-time. OA articles remain fully visible on article
            pages, including the complete body text, metadata, and citation tools.

          <h2>Non-OA</h2>
          <p>
            Non-OA articles keep discovery features open: title, authors, metadata, abstract, keywords, and citation
            tools remain public. The full article body is gated behind a reader membership in this demo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-OA reader membership is <strong>$9.9/month</strong>. A separate lifetime support option is also shown
            below for demonstration purposes.
