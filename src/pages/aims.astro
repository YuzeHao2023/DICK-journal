        <h1>Researching everyday expertise with disciplinary seriousness</h1>
        <p>
          Disciplinary Inquiries into Casual Knowledge (DICK) publishes scholarship on how practical knowledge is
          produced, circulated, contested, and stabilized in ordinary life. The journal demo is designed to feel
          institutional, legible, and methodologically exacting.

          <h2>Scope of inquiry</h2>
          <p>
            We welcome work that examines informal guidance, everyday heuristics, lay expertise, practical rumor,
            situated instruction, and emergent norms of credibility in daily interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions may be qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, historical, conceptual, or computational,
            provided they clearly define the object of inquiry and the evidentiary basis for their claims.
          </p>

          <h2>Priority contributions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Empirical studies of knowledge transmission in public, domestic, institutional, or hybrid settings.</li>
            <li>Methods papers that improve transparency, coding reliability, or field-note traceability.</li>
            <li>Replication studies that test portability across contexts, cultures, and infrastructures.</li>
            <li>Scholarly interventions that refine concepts used to describe informal expertise.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What we do not publish</h2>
          <p>
            The journal does not prioritize purely anecdotal pieces, unverified claims presented as social fact,
            or descriptive narratives without a stated analytical framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also discourage submissions that rely on "common sense" categories without showing how those
            categories were operationalized in the research process.
