        <h1>Researching everyday expertise with disciplinary seriousness</h1>
        <p>
          Disciplinary Inquiries into Casual Knowledge (DICK) publishes scholarship on how practical knowledge,
          playful culture, marginal topics, and informal social worlds are produced, circulated, contested, and
          stabilized. We explicitly welcome "unserious" subject matter, but require serious methods.

          <h2>Scope of inquiry</h2>
          <p>
            We welcome work that examines informal guidance, everyday heuristics, lay expertise, practical rumor,
            situated instruction, and emergent norms of credibility in daily interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions may be qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, historical, conceptual, or computational,
            provided they clearly define the object of inquiry and the evidentiary basis for their claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our editorial stance is simple: the object of study can be playful, awkward, marginal, or culturally
            unserious; the research process must still be auditable, documented, and defensible.
          </p>

          <h2>Methodological seriousness, unserious domains</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage work on topics that are often dismissed as too trivial, embarrassing, online, or socially
            marginal for formal inquiry when the submission demonstrates methodological clarity and ethical restraint.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Foot-fetish signifiers in pop culture and memes (non-explicit, representational analysis only).</li>
            <li>Anti-cheat benchmarking and detection evaluation (no cheat-building or evasion guides).</li>
            <li>Laboratory tacit norms, informal rules, and everyday governance in research groups.</li>
            <li>Phrase pragmatics, such as context-dependent uses of "I'm gay" in discourse analysis.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are particularly interested in submissions that make coding choices, dataset boundaries, annotation
            procedures, and limitations legible to readers.
          </p>

          <h2>Priority contributions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Empirical studies of knowledge transmission in public, domestic, institutional, or hybrid settings.</li>
            <li>Methods papers that improve transparency, coding reliability, or field-note traceability.</li>
            <li>Replication studies that test portability across contexts, cultures, and infrastructures.</li>
            <li>Scholarly interventions that refine concepts used to describe informal expertise.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What we do not publish</h2>
          <p>
            The journal does not reject topics for being odd, playful, or culturally low-status. It does reject
            submissions that substitute provocation for analysis or risk for method.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No explicit sexual content or erotic instruction.</li>
            <li>No how-to illegal content, no evasion guidance for wrongdoing, and no cheat construction.</li>
            <li>No identifiable gossip, personal accusations, or doxxing.</li>
            <li>No shock or "edgelord" submissions that aim to provoke without analytical contribution.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also decline work that relies on unexamined "common sense" categories without documenting how claims
            were operationalized, evidenced, and checked.
