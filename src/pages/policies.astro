        <h1>Review integrity, research ethics, and sensitive-topic handling</h1>
        <p>
          DICK is a demonstration journal, but its policy language models serious editorial practice. The aim is
          to make standards explicit so authors, reviewers, and editors operate with consistent expectations,
          including when the topic itself is playful, stigmatized, or academically marginalized.

          <h2>Peer review model</h2>
          <p>
            The journal uses editor-mediated peer review with at least two expert reviewers for research and
            replication submissions. Methods notes may proceed with one specialist reviewer and one methodological
            editor when domain novelty is limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Topic prestige is not a criterion for acceptance. We welcome "unserious" subject matter when the methods,
            documentation, and inferential claims are serious enough to survive review.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial editorial screening checks scope fit, clarity, and baseline methodological sufficiency.</li>
            <li>Reviewer invitations prioritize disciplinary fit and conflict-of-interest screening.</li>
            <li>Decision letters distinguish required revisions from advisory suggestions.</li>
            <li>Editors may decline resubmission when core evidentiary issues remain unresolved.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Ethics and transparency</h2>
          <p>
            Authors must report ethics review status, consent procedures where applicable, data limitations, and
            any material constraints affecting reproducibility. If data cannot be shared, the reason must be stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage codebooks, synthetic examples, and procedural documentation as alternatives when direct
            release of raw materials would expose participants, workplaces, or vulnerable communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object of study can be playful; the research process must remain auditable and defensible. This is
            a core editorial requirement, not a style preference.

          <h2>Sensitive topics and populations</h2>
          <p>
            Research involving minors, protected classes, stigmatized health conditions, precarious labor, or
            high-surveillance environments requires heightened care in recruitment, reporting, and example selection.
          </p>
          <p>
            This includes research on memes, subcultures, slang, and online behavior when examples can be
            decontextualized, inflammatory, or identifying outside their original settings.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid unnecessary detail that enables re-identification through contextual clues.</li>
            <li>Separate analytic interpretation from participant characterization.</li>
            <li>Describe harms, risks, and mitigation strategies in methods and limitations sections.</li>
            <li>Do not present speculative causal claims as policy recommendations without evidence.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Corrections and post-publication updates</h2>
          <p>
            Substantive factual errors may be corrected with editor notes. Retractions are reserved for invalidated
            findings, severe methodological misrepresentation, or ethical breaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demonstration interface can display revised metadata, version notes, and corrected article records if
            you extend the content schema in a later iteration.
